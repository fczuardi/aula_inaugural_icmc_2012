  <blockquote>
    How to use Facebook safely<br>
    Here’s the easy solution: don’t fucking surveil yourself! If you want to stay safe on Facebook, the answer is, you should not use it, and don’t tag people!

    What’s the greatest database of Jews on the planet? Facebook. What will 
    happen when you want the biggest database of leftists on the planet? Or 
    right wing people? That’s really, really scary, so one way to not be part 
    of that dataset is to not put yourself in it voluntarily, and to chastise 
    people who only hang out with you to tag you in facebook as a sort of 
    conspicuous consumption of the 21st Century say: "Hey, if that’s all you 
    get out of our friendship then go fuck yourself!"
